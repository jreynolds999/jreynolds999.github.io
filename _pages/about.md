Jonathan started his career at Apple, Inc on the Genius Bar where he was responsible for troubleshooting software and hardware issues, then recommending complete solutions that required extensive understanding of the Apple products and services ecosystem. Within 3 months, Jonathan was awarded the recognition of “Most Improved Technician” for his outstanding ability to not only solve customer’s problems, but also his eagerness to learn and share his knowledge with the team. Jonathan is most proud of his ability to generate creative solutions, a skill that blossomed at Apple with his creation and implementation of a new organizational system for management and technicians on the Genius Bar. 

Following his time at Apple, Jonathan tapped into his entrepreneurial side and started his own consulting firm, JLReynolds Consulting, to help clients solve business strategy and operations related problems. These opportunities typically centered around formulating business plans, standardizing business decisions, defining business needs and then identifying the resources required to accomplish them as best and quickly as possible.

As a result of work completed with clients looking to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets, Jonathan realized that in order to solve continuously larger problems he needed an upgrade to his technical skillset in order to keep pace with the evolving business environment. Thanks to a recommendation from a close friend, Jonathan attended General Assembly’s 3-month Data Science bootcamp in NYC. During this program, he completed several projects that included data processing, data analysis, predictive modeling and data visualization in Python and SQL.

Jonathan now continues his work of assisting clients solve increasingly technical problems, with recent examples being:
1. Creating the framework for a visual machine learning system for a laser tattoo removal company, and performing data analysis on the existing customers in order to better identify and classify them.
2. Improving web automation scripts to scrape public banking data in Python for an economic research firm using beautifulsoup and selenium.

In his spare time, Jonathan enjoys building communities and helping them flourish. 

The first is a monthly tech community of over 180 investors and tech enthusiasts who share interests in Bitcoin, distributed ledger technology and other digital assets. Founded in 2018 by Jonathan, the Greenwich Cryptocurrency Meetup is always open to new members and is an excellent resource for programmers, investors, founders and anyone who is interested in learning more about the future of finance.

The second is the NYC Occidental Alumni Organization, of which Jonathan is a Host Committee member. In this role, Jonathan is responsible for assisting in the planning and execution of alumni events in the Greater NYC area. Additionally, Jonathan is the Class Secretary of the Occidental Alumni class of 2015 and maintains communications with the graduated class in order to keep the college up to date on their accomplishments.
